## Description

This is a website that I created for a client in 2017. It's a static page with a very small amount of jQuery and JavaScript and built primarily using bootstrap v3.7. 

It's recieved many incremental updates over the years and generates a decent amount of traffic for the client - up to 800 views a month.

The files were originally intended to use PHP, however during development the client made it known to me that he would rather have a single scrolling page rather than multiple pages. It currently does not connect to any databases.
